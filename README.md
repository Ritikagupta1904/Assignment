## Features

### Level 1: Authentication Screen
- Users can log in with credentials:
  - **Email**: eve.holt@reqres.in
  - **Password**: cityslicka
- Upon successful login, a token is stored in local storage, and the user is redirected to the Users List page.

### Level 2: List All Users
- Fetch and display a paginated list of users from the Reqres API.
- Each user displays the first name, last name, and avatar.
- Implemented pagination for smooth navigation through user pages.

### Level 3: Edit, Delete, and Update Users
- **Edit**: Update user details like first name, last name, and email.
- **Delete**: Remove a user from the list.
- API endpoints are used to reflect changes.
- Success and error messages are displayed appropriately.

### Bonus Features:
- **React Router** for navigation between pages.
- Client-side search and filtering for users.
- Responsive design using **Bootstrap** for an enhanced user experience.

## Deployed Application
The project has been deployed on **Netlify** and can be accessed at:
[https://playful-stroopwafel-177593.netlify.app](https://playful-stroopwafel-177593.netlify.app)

---

## Assumptions
- The application assumes the Reqres API responds as per its documentation.
- Only basic form validation is implemented.
- The token is stored in local storage for simplicity.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add real authentication with dynamic credentials.
- Enhance form validation.
- Implement a more robust state management solution (e.g., Redux).
